Molecular mechanisms of adaptogens
Several studies have shown that adaptogens have an anti-fatigue effect that increases mental performance under conditions of stress and fatigue. They have neuroprotective, anti-fatigue, antidepressant, anxiolytic, nootropic and CNS stimulating effects. At the molecular level, the anti-stress activity of adaptogens has been linked to the regulation of homeostasis through several mechanisms of action related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the regulation of key mediators of the stress response, such as molecular chaperones. Adaptogens therefore act on key mediators of the adaptive stress response and increase the adaptability of the organism, suggesting the usefulness of their prophylactic use by healthy individuals to improve the stress response.
