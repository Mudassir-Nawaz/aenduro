#### What is fatigue?
Physical or mental fatigue is common in healthy people and can be influenced by a number of factors, including age, gender, excessive or insufficient physical activity, stress, overwork, sleep deprivation, psychological state, and health status. Fatigue can be classified as acute or chronic and can be either a physiological response to intense exertion or a pathological condition. Fatigue and fatigability must be distinguished from conditions such as sleepiness, apathy, exercise intolerance, lack of energy, weakness, sluggishness, or exhaustion. 
In most cases, fatigue is a temporary condition that is easily resolved, but if you feel tired all the time, you should see a doctor because chronic fatigue can be caused by a variety of conditions. 
For example, fatigue may be an early sign of an allergy or food intolerance; if you suspect you have an allergy or food intolerance, ask your doctor to test you for an allergy or food intolerance.
Anemia, a condition in which there are fewer red blood cells in the blood, is a common cause of chronic fatigue, especially in women who have heavy menstrual cycles. Common causes of anemia include lack of iron or folic acid (also known as vitamin B9); note that vitamin C can help absorb iron from meals and thus counteract anemia.
Fatigue can be modulated by exercise, mental state, mental/physical stress, or medications.


#### Molecular mechanisms of adaptogens 
Several studies have shown that adaptogens have an anti-fatigue effect that increases mental performance under conditions of stress and fatigue. They have neuroprotective, anti-fatigue, antidepressant, anxiolytic, nootropic and CNS stimulating effects. 
At the molecular level, the anti-stress activity of adaptogens has been linked to the regulation of homeostasis through several mechanisms of action related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the regulation of key mediators of the stress response, such as molecular chaperones. Adaptogens therefore act on key mediators of the adaptive stress response and increase the adaptability of the organism, suggesting the usefulness of their prophylactic use by healthy individuals to improve the stress response.
